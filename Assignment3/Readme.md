### Feedback from TA

> Good effort on the code, your results are all correct. The report, however, has no explanation of the code. The report is critical to show that you understand the code and can explain it to someone else, especially in the times of LLMs who can write the code for you.
>
> The code for task 5 has detailed comments, which count towards the explanation requirements.

> Hello, thanks for reaching out. I took another look at your submission files since we made a decision to allow code comments to count as explanation. However only the code for task 5 has comments. This raises your mark to a 72. I think this is fair to do as your comments show you understand what you are doing. However, for task 1-4 I cannot give you any marks for the explanation since that would be unfair to your classmates. I hope you understand. I will update your mark in blackboard soon
